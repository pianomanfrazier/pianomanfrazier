### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my previous life I aspired to be a concert pianist. I played lots of piano and traveled a bit. Hear me play a Beethoven Trio, Copland, and a Liszt Concerto.

I have 3 degrees, a bachelor's of Music in Piano Performance, a Master's degree in Piano Performance and Pedagogy, and finally a 2nd bachelor's in Computer Science (Spring 2018). I am done with school, but not done learning. ðŸ˜‰

### My Writing

In my [Elm Calculator Book](https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/elm-calculator-book/01-intro/) I walk through building a calculator using the Elm programming language.
